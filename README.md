# AIMonkeyPlanner
This is a program that solves a user given problem where a monkey is in a laboratory. The lab has three different rooms and one of the rooms contains bananas that the monkey wants. The bananas are hanging from the ceiling so even if the monkey is in the same room it needs to be elevated to grab the bananas. The monkey needs a box to climb on which is also in one of the lab rooms. 

When the program is run, it prompts the user to select where the bananas, monkey, and box start. It does this by asking the user to select which room to place each of the items. From there, the program generates a plan on how the monkey will get the bananas.
